# libturbojpeg-ios

Just a script to build libjpeg-turbo binaries for iOS with bitcode enabled.

Builds armv7, arm64, i386 and x86_64 (universal binary).

(note: armv7s is not required anymore and is skipped in this script)

This script was set up thanks to [this blog post](https://macteo.it/build/2016/08/09/libjpeg-turbo-with-bitcode.html) and libjpeg-turbo build documentation.
